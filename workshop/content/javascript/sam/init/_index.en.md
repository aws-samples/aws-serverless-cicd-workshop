AWS SAM provides you with a command line tool, the AWS SAM CLI, that makes it easy for you to create and manage serverless applications. It particularly makes easy the scaffolding of a new project, as it creates the initial skeleton of a hello world application, so you can use it as a baseline and continue building your project from there. 

Run the following command to scaffold a new project:
```bash
sam init
```

It will prompt for project configuration parameters: 

#### Type `1` to select AWS Quick Start Templates

#### Type `1` to select Zip as the package type

#### Choose `nodejs12.x` for runtime

#### Leave default `sam-app` for project name

#### Type `Y` to accept download from GitHub

#### Type `1` to select the `Hello World Example`

{{% notice tip %}}
This command supports cookiecutter templates, so you could write your own custom scaffolding templates and specify them using the location flag, For example: sam init --location git+ssh://git@github.com/aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-python.git.

## Project should now be initialized

You should see a new folder `sam-app` created with a basic Hello World scaffolding.
