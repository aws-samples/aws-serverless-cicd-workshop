# Manual deploy to AWS

Before we start building a fully automated continous delivery pipeline, in this chapter you will learn how to build, package and deploy a Serverless application by using the AWS SAM CLI.

Even though this workshop is about automating deployments, this chapter is very important to learn the foundation of how to package and deploy a Serverless application. Learning how to perform manual deployments is also useful for developers who want to create their own personal stack and deploy it often to test changes before commiting them to the source control repository.
