AWS SAM provides you with a command line tool, the AWS SAM CLI, that makes it easy for you to create
and manage serverless applications. It particularly makes easy the scaffolding of a new project, as
it creates the initial skeleton of a hello world application, so you can use it as a baseline and
continue building your project from there.

Run the following command to scaffold a new project:

```bash
sam init
```

In the wizard, select `AWS QuickStart Templates` and `Hello World Example`. Do **not** use the
shortcut to use the latest Python version.

{{% notice tip %}}
This command supports cookiecutter templates, so you could write your own custom scaffolding
templates and specify them using the location flag.
For example: `sam init --location git+ssh://git@github.com/aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-python.git`

## Project should now be initialized

You should see a new folder `sam-app` created with a basic Hello World scaffolding.
